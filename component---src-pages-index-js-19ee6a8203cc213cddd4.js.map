We use\n      public cloud where possible, taking advantage of the cost, availability\n      and performance advantages supplied by cloud providers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Our services are comprised of small loosely-coupled components that can be\n      swapped in and out and deployed independently. Our aspiration is to be\n      able to move implementations across different cloud platforms. This means\n      we focus on cloud native solutions, packaged as Docker containers and\n      orchestrated using Kubernetes. However, with our eye on the future, we\n      have taken advantage of serverless computing for our API platform,\n      utilising products such as AWS API Gateway, Cognito and Lambda.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We support a number of programming languages, frameworks and runtime\n      engines, including Java, React and Node.js. With our move to immutable\n      infrastructure our software and infrastructure is defined in code, and\n      deployed through our continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)\n      pipeline.\n    </p>\n  </>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
